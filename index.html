       <h3>Introduction</h3>
       In CCIS-1301 (HTML5) I was able to learn the Internet $ Web basics, CSS3,HTML5 <br>
       and their different functions/uses. For this article, I tried to gain more information<br>
       from 3 different articles from online.<br>
       Below i am going to name the different point i learned in this class;<br>

       <h3>Internet & Web Basics</h3>
       The Internet is a worldwide telecommunications system that provides connectivity for<br>
       millions of other, smaller networks. The Internet is referred to as a network of networks.<br>
       It allows computer users to communicate with each other across distance and computer <br>
       platforms. The protocol used for web resources is HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

      <a name="html"></a><h3>HTML5 Basics</h3>
      HTML stands for Hypertext MarkUp Language and HTML5 is the latest version which came<br>
      in 2014.The role of HTML is to provide the basic skeleton of the website, itâ€™s structural<br>
      elements and building block. The frontend is the part of the website that you see in your<br>
      browser when visiting any website. In HTML5, many things have been simplified. A number of <br>
      HTML tags have been removed or merged into a single, more obvious version that make them<br>
      easier to use and remember. Below, are some of HTML5 functions I learned;<br>
<ul>
       Heading<br>
       Paragraph<br>
       Line break <br>
       Blockquote element<br>
       How to write/make ordered and unordered list<br>
       And email hyperlink
</ul>

      <a name="css"></a><h3>Cascading Style Sheet (CSS3)</h3>
      CSS, on the other hand, adds styling in form of colors, shapes, fonts and other design elements <br>
      while JavaScript can be used to make things more interactive and influence how elements behave.<br>
      CSS is stands for Cascading Style Sheets, it is the primary language used to describe look and <br>
      formatting for webpages across the HTML and XML in general, for us we used it along with HTML5.<br>
      CSS allows us to easily apply rules about formatting and layout to our HTML elements and then re-use <br>
      those rules across multiple elements and even pages. I learned some CSS codes and how to use. Among<br>
      those coding are; syntax for color values, configuration of Inline, Embedded, and External CSS, CSS <br>
      selectors such as Id, class, and descendant. Span element, the cascade, CSS syntax validation, how<br>
      to edit width, height, margin, borders, and padding with CSS
       
       
     <a name="graph"></a><h3>Graphics and Text Styling Basics</h3>
     CSS graphics and text styling are a shorter and sweeter method of controlling font display, and are<br>
     supported by modern browsers. I learned how they work, how to set up and position images, how to <br>
     use multiple background, font, and text properties all in CSS, how to change it all by editing one file.<br>
     Client doesn't like the Arial? Wants a new text color scheme? No problem! A quick edit, and you're done.
       
     
      <a name="concl"></a><h3>Summary</h3>
      From my point of view, learning HTML5 and CSS3 gave me a huge boost in web designing. <br>
      I can now design my own nice webpage and also for others.<br>
